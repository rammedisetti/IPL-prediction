TOSS WINNING TEAM MODEL:

1. I have used the juypter note book for this project and this project can predict toss winner based on venue and teams that are playing.
2. This model is only 50% accurate in predicting the data as the data is not sufficient enough to predict more accurate

MATCH WINNING TEAM MODEL:

1. I have used the juypter note book for this project and this project can predict winning team based on toss winner and toss decision the team makes 
2. This model is around 65% accurate in predicting the data
